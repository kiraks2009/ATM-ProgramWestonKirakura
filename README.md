# Simple ATM program

This was a safaricom hackerthon program for quality control to create a simple ATM program. This program was created using java language on the Netbeans IDE.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You require to set up a java environment. Download and Install the java jDK from the oracle website.
A java development IDE platform Like Netbeans or Eclipse. For this project we used netbeans 8.0.2. You can download Netbeans from the netbeans.org page.
A suitable relationship database like mysql. For this use a graphical user interface like mysql Yog.

### Installing

The Java Development Kit (JDK) named "Java Platform Standard Edition" or "Java SE", is required for writing Java programs. This article will help you set up the jdk for the different operating systems. https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_Howto.html

Dopwnload the latest netbeans IDE netbeans.org Since july 2018, the official site is now https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html

Download the free Mysql platform for creating the database. I suggest using the popular and easy to use mysql Yog community edition. This is a free edition of the mysql client with most of the features required for development. This article guides you on how to do this. https://sqlyogkb.webyog.com/article/24-getting-started
